# libpt

Libpt is a fast hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallel implementation of the CCSD(T) energy
correction for the distributed multiprocessor systems. Due to hybrid design the
code efficiently uses fast memory by sharing data within a single node while
using MPI for inter-node communication. The code exhibits excellent scalability
up to hundreds of cores.

The benchmark was performed using 1 MPI process per node with 8 threads per
process. The benchmark parameters were `o = 30` and `v = 230`.
