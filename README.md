# libpt

Libpt is a fast MPI/OpenMP parallel implementation of the coupled-cluster
CCSD(T) and EOM-CCSD(fT) energy corrections for clusters of computers and SMP
systems. Libpt is the default implementation of perturbative triples
corrections in the [Q-Chem](http://www.q-chem.com) package.

### Usage

The API defines several functions:

- `libpt_rpt` - compute CCSD(T) energy correction for the restricted case
- `libpt_upt` - compute CCSD(T) energy correction for the unrestricted case
- `libpt_rft` - compute EOM-CCSD(fT) energy correction for the restricted case
- `libpt_uft` - compute EOM-CCSD(fT) energy correction for the unrestricted case

All functions are MPI/OpenMP parallel. The detailed documentation can be found
in the `pt.h` file. To use libpt in your project, include `pt.h` header and add
`pt.c` to the list of project source files. OpenMP is enabled automatically
when appropriate OpenMP compiler flags are used. Defining `WITH_MPI` during
compilation enables MPI support.

### Benchmarks

Libpt shows excellent performance both on single workstations as well as on
distributed clusters of computers. Parallel scalability benchmarks on the NERSC
Cori Cray XC40 supercomputer (32 CPU cores per node) are shown below. A cluster
of 9 water molecules with the cc-pVTZ basis set (522 basis functions in total)
was used as a benchmark system.
